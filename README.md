<h2> Setup </h2>
Our code is split up into two parts, a server file and a client file.
Servers must be initialized first for a client to connect, so create 
a server by running <code><b>go run server.go {port number}</b></code>. To 
create a client, run <code><b>go run client.go {host address} {port number} {username}</b></code>.
For the purposes of this assignment, we have decided to limit the host address to 
127.0.0.1 so clients can only connect to servers on the same machine.
